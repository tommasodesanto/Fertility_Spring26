# E5 target review ledger (2026-07-24)

Row-by-row author review of the E5 target system. Each row is registered here
when signed off in discussion. Format: target, source, parameter connection.
This file becomes the E5 contract table when the review completes.

## Standing decisions (author-confirmed today)

- Fertility cohort anchor: women 40--44 in the June 2024 CPS fertility
  supplement, i.e. birth cohorts 1979--84 -- the youngest essentially-complete
  cohort. Mild completeness caveat (a few percent of births still ahead at
  40--44) disclosed in the note.
- Environment (prices, incomes, entrant wealth, housing menus) stays measured
  on 2019--2023 cross-sections; the seam between the fertility cohort and the
  modern environment is one disclosed assumption (preferences stable across
  adjacent cohorts).
- Top-bin convention: the CPS public file topcodes children at five, so the
  top-bin mean among 3+ families is the CAPPED mean (~3.602, builder to
  confirm). Adopted as measured, truncation disclosed; no uncapping
  adjustment. Replaces the provisional 3.4. The model's completed-fertility
  moment must use the same capped weight so model and data means share one
  convention.
- Stocks builder: `code/data/cps_fertility/` owned by the M agent
  (download+checksum manifest, sample definition, bootstrap SEs and
  covariance, window sensitivities). The E strand consumes the CSV.
- Timing rows: built by the E strand from NCHS cohort fertility tables
  (birth-certificate based) for the same 1979--84 cohorts.
- Period synthetic-cohort package (TFR ~1.62, synthetic childlessness, mafb
  ~27.3, share 30+) = declared robustness bracket at freeze time, not in E5.

## Registered rows

### Row 1 -- Completed fertility [SIGNED OFF 2026-07-24]

- Target: 1.918 (1.918425 reproduced from microdata). Mean children ever born
  per woman at ages 40--44. Model: mean parity over post-fertile ages, 3+ bin
  at the measured capped mean from the same builder.
- Source: CPS June 2024 supplement, women 40--44 (cohorts 1979--84); builder
  + SEs in progress (M agent).
- Connection: primary parameter psi (per-child utility flow). psi raises the
  value of every birth attempt, entry and continuation alike, so it shifts
  the level of completed childbearing; mean completed parity is the level
  statistic. Block-identified with (kappa_E, kappa_C) against the four
  fertility rows; completed fertility is psi's primary assignment.
  Cross-loads disclosed: fecundity (external), expenditure tilts, house
  prices.
